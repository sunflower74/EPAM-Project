## Portfolio
This is my portfolio based on the practical tasks from the EPAM ¨Software Testing Introduction¨ course.  All of the tasks are coherent and are focused on the development and testing of a web application ¨File Converter¨. 
The folder includes 3 files named ¨Req analysis¨, ¨Checklists & Test cases¨, ¨Bug Reports¨

## 1.File  [¨Req analysis¨](https://github.com/sunflower74/Portfolio/blob/main/Req%20analysis.pdf)
here I analysed the Set of Requirements given, found and categorized some defects and wrote questions to the Customer to clarify the ambiguous issues.
## 2.File  [¨Checklists & Test cases¨](https://github.com/sunflower74/Portfolio/blob/main/Checklists%20%26%20Test%20cases.pdf)
based on the requirements above, I elaborated the checklists for the smoke test and the critical path test of the file converter as well as the corresponding test cases. 
## 3.File [¨Bug Reports¨](https://github.com/sunflower74/Portfolio/blob/main/Bug%20Reports.pdf)
after testing the application I detected several bugs and wrote bug reports. In addition to that I also offered several enhancements to the product.
